1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

    No, because the message feature includes interacting with other features, such as sending data over a connection. But it depends on how the message feature is implemented, I think it could be unit tested if written a certain way, however the test would not be as useful.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

    Yes, because it is a small feature that does not depend on anything else, so it would be easy to unit test.
